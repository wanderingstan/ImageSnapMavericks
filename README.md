Capture Images from Camera
==========================
Forked and improved from: https://github.com/samgreen/ImageSnapMavericks, which was forked and improved from: http://iharder.net/imagesnap

A collection of methods for capturing still images from an iSight or other video source. Unlike the original ImageSnap, this version has separated the command line application from the camera methods, allowing this to be used as a library within other applications. For example, it is used in LifeSlice https://github.com/wanderingstan/LifeSlice

It still includes the original command-line tool that lets you capture still images from an iSight or other video source.

Installation as Library
=======================
Include the ImageSnap.m and ImageSnap.h files in your project and add `import "ImageSnap.h"` to your source code. 

Installation of Command-Line Tool
=================================
Copy the imagesnap file to someplace on your path like `/usr/local/bin`, or leave it in a "current directory," and call it with `imagesnap` instead.

Usage
=============
To capture an image simply run the program from the command line.

`$ imagesnap
Capturing image from device "iSight"..................snapshot.jpg`

To specify a filename, make that your last argument:

`$ imagesnap icu.jpg
Capturing image from device "iSight"..................icu.jpg`

If you have multiple video devices attached to your computer, use the -l (lowercase L) flag to list them:

`$ imagesnap -l
Video Devices:
iSight
DV`

To select a specific video device use the -d device flag:

`$ imagesnap -d DV
Capturing image from device "DV"..................snapshot.jpg`

To output a jpeg representation to standard out (stdout), use a dash for the filename:

`$ ssh johndoe@somewhere.com /usr/local/bin/imagesnap - > snapshot.jpg
$ open snapshot.jpg`

Image Formats
=============
The following image formats are supported and are determined by the filename extension: JPEG, TIFF, PNG, GIF, BMP.

Changes
=============
 * v0.3.0 - Removed QTKit dependency and converted application to use AVFoundation instead.
 * v0.2.5 - Added option to delay the first snapshot for some time. Added a time-lapse feature (thanks, Bas Zoetekouw).
 * v0.2.4 - Found bug that caused crash on Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.6).
 * v0.2.4beta - Tracking bug that causes crash on Mac OS X 10.5 (but not 10.6).
 * v0.2.3 - Fixed bug that caused all images to be saved as TIFF. Not sure when this bug was introduced.
 * v0.2.2 - Added ability to output jpeg to standard out. Made executable lowercase imagesnap.
 * v0.2.1 - Changed name from ImageCapture to ImageSnap to avoid confusion with Apple's Image Capture application.
 * v0.2 - Multiple file formats (not just TIFF). Faster response.
 * v0.1 - This is the initial release.
